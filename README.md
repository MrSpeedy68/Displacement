You are a wizard/inventor, and in a medieval fantasy world, you've just invented the concept of portals. Fearing that this new innovation would disrupt the transport industry, you are imprisoned for daring to come up with such an idea.

During your prison sentence, an energy crystal powering the prison surges, killing everyone but you.

With a sharp mind and the magic you were imprisoned for inventing, can you find the 3 gems, open the main door and walk to freedom?
